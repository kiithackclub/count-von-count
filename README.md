# Count Von Count

Keeping an eye on KIIT Hack Club Discord's #count-to-ten-thousand channel, this bot is custom made to enforce the counting rules.

## Environment variables

To get this app working you first need to create a `.env` file which will have some variables. Here are all the variables you need to set up, with hints.

BOT_NAME = `username of your bot with delimiters`<br>
BOT_TOKEN = `your bot token`<br>
CHANNEL_ID = `channel ID where Count Von Count should validate counted numbers in`
